# Excel-and-GMap-GUI
An GUI that uses GMap and Excel libraries.
Currently a work-in-progress.
The end result is a GUI that extracts, displays and edit data from an excel sheet.
the GUi should also have a GMap with multiple locations on it.
The Sheet needs to be in the same basic drive as the src file or Jar.
Currently the work needs commenting on most files and fixing of a few bugs

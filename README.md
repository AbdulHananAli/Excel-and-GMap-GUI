# Excel-and-GMap-GUI
An (javaFx) GUI that uses GMap and Excel libraries.
Currently a Work-In-Progress.
The end result is a GUI that extracts, displays and edit data from an excel sheet.
The GUI should also have a GMap with multiple locations on it (unless internet connections issues, left click page to reload)
The excel Sheet needs to be in the same basic drive as the "src" file or Jar (if a jar is made). 
The file path code is in "source.java" file.
Currently, works but needs commenting on most files and fixing of a few bugs.
Files already commented on are AppGUI,GMap,GMap_data.
Known bugs: 1) the textfeild options box (Combo Box) is sometimes not attached to the textfeild.
Irrelevent code needs to be removed and code needs to be better structured. 
To start the GUI run the AppGUI file.
